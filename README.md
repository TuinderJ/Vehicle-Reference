## User Story 
---






This app was built to allow a user to login and search for different truck models specifically for parts details. Truck specific parts, engine specific parts and special parts associated with certain trucks such as lift gates and refrigeration are included details. The app will show truck details from the VIN number to the year of the specific truck saved in the database to its engine type, model and part numbers such as oil and fuel filters, cabin and engine air filters and tires. This application will simplify the tasks of the user by providing details of the trucks and parts all in one place allowing them to easily look up and research parts for replacement ordering and servicing of the trucks.
